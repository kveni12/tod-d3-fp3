	"If things start to slip, we want to protect the main argument first instead of trying to save every feature. We would regroup quickly, figure out what is actually blocked, and rebalance the work so one person is not carrying the whole critical path. If the data becomes the problem, we would narrow the demographic side to the clearest lenses, income and race, and cut weaker side analyses. If time becomes the problem, we would keep the tract choropleth, tract grouping logic, and one strong linked demographic comparison as the core of the project, then simplify secondary interactions or extra charts. If the story itself starts to feel too broad, we would narrow it to one clear claim about how TOD-related tracts differ from other tracts, rather than trying to answer every housing question at once.";
